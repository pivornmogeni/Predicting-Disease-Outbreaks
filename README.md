# Predicting-Disease-Outbreaks
This project addresses SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by building a machine learning model to predict disease outbreaks based on historical health data and environmental factors


# Carbon Emissions Forecasting Using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised learning (linear regression) to forecast COâ‚‚ emissions using GDP, year, and energy consumption. It supports SDG 13 (Climate Action) by helping visualize and predict emissions trends.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place `co2_emissions.csv` in the `data/` folder
4. Run the model: `python co2_forecast.py`

## Tools Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib

## SDG Impact

By forecasting emissions, this tool can support better policy decisions and long-term planning for climate action.
