## Forecasting CO₂ Emissions in Kenya Using Linear Regression

### 🎯 The Problem
Climate change is largely driven by CO₂ emissions. Governments need predictive tools to make informed decisions about emissions reduction and climate policy. This project tackles **SDG 13: Climate Action** by forecasting CO₂ emissions in Kenya.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
We used **supervised learning (Linear Regression)** to model historical data and predict emissions based only on year.

### 📈 Dataset
Data sourced from global CO₂ emissions datasets. Only data for Kenya was used.

### 🔬 Results
- **MAE**: 1.13M tonnes
- **R² Score**: 79.8%
- The model successfully captures emission trends over time.

### ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- **Bias**: Using year alone may oversimplify trends and ignore economic or policy factors.
- **Impact**: Helps policymakers anticipate future emissions and take pre-emptive action.

### 💡 Conclusion
This ML-based forecast demonstrates how even simple models can support climate-related decision-making and contribute to global sustainability goals.
